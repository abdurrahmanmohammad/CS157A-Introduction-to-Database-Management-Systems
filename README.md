Project Overview

This is a prototype of a course management system that is similar to that used in colleges. It is a database application that displays course schedules, allows students to enroll in classes, and allows students to view their course history and transcripts.

Project Description
This is a prototype of a course management system that is similar to that used in colleges. It is a database application that displays course schedules, allows students to enroll in classes, and allows students to view their course history and transcripts.

Goals
The purpose of this application is to facilitate administration and student interactions for course enrollment and management. The goal is to make it easier for administrators to create, modify, and display course schedules just as how courses are displayed in a course schedule or catalog. Another goal is to simplify course viewing, course enrollment, and account history for students. Administrators will be able to create courses offered by their institution and then with those courses, create a course schedule offered during the current term. Students will be able to view the current and past schedules and register for courses offered in the current term. Simply, the goal is to create a simple, user-friendly course management system that allows administrators to host classes and students to register.

Motivation
Currently, course management systems are cluttered with unnecessary features and can sometimes become overwhelming. They are often hard to learn and adapt and look ugly. They often are buggy and are not user-friendly. An ideal course management system performs the basic task of displaying courses and allows students to register for these courses. Nowadays, course management systems have lost their focus and make the user experience extremely unpleasant when registering for courses. This system will solve these problems and will make it easier for administrators to host courses and students to add courses without much hassle. The system will make the user experience pleasant and will be robust and secure. Institutions need quality course management systems and there arenâ€™t many good ones. Another motivation for the development of this system is to create a simple course management system that can accommodate development for smaller institutions, businesses, non-profits, recreation centers, and community centers that offer courses but do not have a proper course management system that displays courses and allows students to register for their courses online. The motivation is to develop a product that is accessible and convenient for smaller public and private organizations that are in need of such a system like this.

Stakeholders
The stakeholders of this system include the project drivers and designers, Abdurrahman Mohammad, Susmita Goswami, and Anudeep Gogineni. All future employees hired, such as web developers and Java software engineers, will also serve as stakeholders. The clients using this system are also stakeholders as well as their users, instructors, administrators - such as the school bursar -, employees, and students. Anyone responsible for the development, maintenance, and use of this system are stakeholders.

Application Domain
The system will be used in the academic, the education industry, and private sector that offer courses and consequently have a need of such product. The system will be hosted on a web server. Interaction with this application will take place on a server which can be accessed via public or private URL. The system will contain an interface or GUI contacting the application and visualizing data and transactions. Data will be securely stored in a database on the server. The middleman between the database and the GUI will be the actual application responsible for conducting the tasks which lies between the interface and the database.

Benefits to Users
This course management system will be fast, secure, reliable, clutter-free, easy to update, and simple to use which is not the case for most course management systems today. It will be simple to learn and will make it easier for administrators and students to conduct important course management activities. Additional benefit in the future may include students being able to view available classes and filter based on prerequisites and instructors being able to specify prerequisites and control enrollment with fewer manual overrides.


All team members had committed to this repository. The code was initially unorganized. When this repository was synced with eclipse and then organized into folders, GitHub lost track of all changes, edits, and contributor names. I wanted to clarify that all team members have done their part of contributing to the project, even if their names and contribution may not appear on GitHub. I have discussed this with Professor Wu in class and he said that it's ok.
